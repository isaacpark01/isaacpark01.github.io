I am actively seeking an internship, part-time, or full-time job in the field of Information Technology, with a specific focus on CyberSecurity. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a company that utilizes technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. I have just recently completed my Security+. 
Currently, I am engaged in studying for my CCNA and AZ900 certification, expanding my knowledge in IT, and gaining practical experience with VMware. Although I am currently working as a server at Boiling Crab, this role has provided me with valuable teamwork experience.
Throughout my journey, I have explored various career paths, and I have come to the conclusion that I am passionate about pursuing a career as a cybersecurity and cloud engineer/ethical hacker. The reason behind my choice is the profound influence this field has on the world, and I am eager to contribute to its advancements.
By combining my technical skills, passion for technology, and dedication to helping others, I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any organization operating in the Information Technology sector. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my knowledge and continue learning in a professional environment.


My current hobbies are going to the gym, anime, and hanging out with my friends.
