# My favorite Anime of all time


This is not fact, and it will be more opinion based. 
My top five anime in this list are going to be Naruto, Gundam 00, Log Horizon, One piece, and Dragon Ball Z. 
Each anime was part of my childhood and teenage days. I have been watching anime since I was a kid, and I don't have any shame haha. 
I enjoy any anime that talks about life, passion, peace, pain, understanding, and love. 

There are a bunch of shows that I have watched entirely like static shock, avatar the last airbender, jackie chan adventures, justice league, and many more. Cartoon or anime shows are ficitional, but they do speak truth about this world and behaviors that all of us perform.
