# What I learned today
I learned how the what were the differences between switch, routers, firewalls, and pc. Each part is interconnected. 
It first start with the PC/Server which is connected to the switch in order to connect with other PCs and Servers. 
The switch is then connected to the Router which connected to the internet
The before the Router is connected to the internet, it hookup to the firewall which is protecting itself from any malware, viruses or anything that will cause damage to the network it self, 
There are different things that I have learned from the OSI layers, how its more shifting to the TCP/IP model layer.
The different in wires and what pins is going to be used to transfer and receieve data.
